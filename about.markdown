ASU Active Perception Group (APG) is lead by ['YZ' Yezhou Yang](https://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/).
ASU-APG focuses on diverse active-perception research fileds:
* Generative Modeling
* Visual Nevigation
* Intelligent Transportation

In generative modeling, the group is working on various important research problems:
* Security of image diffusion models (e.g., [WOUAF](https://wouaf.vercel.app/))
* Efficiency of text to image diffusion models (e.g., [ECLIPSE](https://eclipse-t2i.vercel.app/))
* Evaluations of text to image generative models (e.g., [ConceptBed](https://conceptbed.github.io/), [Visor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10015))
