Bio: Yezhou (also goes by ‘YZ’) Yang is an Associate Professor at School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence (SCAI), Arizona State University.  He is directing the ASU Active Perception Group. His primary interests lie in Cognitive Robotics, Computer Vision, and Robot Vision, especially exploring visual primitives in human action understanding from visual input, grounding them by natural language as well as high-level reasoning over the primitives for intelligent robots; His research mainly focused on solutions to visual learning, which significantly reduces the time to program intelligent agents. These solutions involve Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and AI algorithms to interpret peoples’ actions and the scene’s geometry. His research draws on the strengths of the symbolic approach, connectionism, and dynamicism.
