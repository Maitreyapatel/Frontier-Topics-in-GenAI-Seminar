  Vision and Language has been growing explonentially in past couple of years. Lot's of cool downstream tasks are becoming better and better such as text-to-image/video/3D generations, multimodal reasoning, and human-alignment. Hence, there is a lot of focus on applied research. But it's important to also focus on fundamental works driving the research. With this goal, we present the Vision-Language seminar series. This seminar will focus on more grounded research works in vision, language and multimodal systems.
